**CoverallsKit** is the library for transmitting the report of code coverage to **coveralls**.  
This library works with **PHP5.4** or more.

Requirements
------------------------------------

* PHP >= 5.4
* Xdebug >= 2.2.2


Install
------------------------------------

Please add the following to composer.json.  
Then please run the composer install.

	"holyshared/coverallskit": "1.2.2"


Basic usage
------------------------------------

You can generate a json file using the **coverallskit/ReportBuilder**.  
You just set the code coverage of rows that have been executed.  
Code coverage can be obtained easily by using the **HHVM** and **xdebug**.

	$builder = new ReportBuilder();
	$builder->token('your repository token')
	    ->service(new TravisCI( new Environment($_SERVER) ))
		->repository(new Repository(__DIR__ . '/../'));

	$source = new SourceFile('path/to/file');

	$coverages = $source->getCoverages();

	$coverages->add(Coverage::executed(1));	//The first line was executed
	$coverages->add(Coverage::unused(2));	//The second line is not executed
	$coverages->add(Coverage::executed(3));	//The third line is executed

	$builder->addSource($source);
	$builder->build()->saveAs(__DIR__ . '/tmp/coverage.json');
